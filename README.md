# ObservationDutyClone
A game cloning a few of the main mechanics of the I'm on Observation Duty 1, 2 & 4 games with a focus on being easily extendable.

Currently includes:
* 2 Example scenes:
  * First (and old one) was a prove of concept with mostly hardcoded everything
  * Second one is a clone of the first one in terms of layout, but uses a codebase that allows easy creation of more events and rooms
* Mechanics:
  * Switching between multiple cameras
  * Win/Failure conditions
  * Automatic starting of independent events
  * Reporting of said events based on room and type
